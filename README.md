# Ferritin-report
NHANES 2021–2023 Ferritin analysis in US women aged 18–49
# Ferritin Levels in US Women Aged 18–49

This project demonstrates my ability to obtain, clean, analyse, and visualise real-world health datasets using Python. The focus is on ferritin levels in US women of reproductive age using NHANES 2021–2023 data.

The notebook has been exported to HTML and contains:

- Data import and preparation
- Population-weighted ferritin distribution
- Visualisations and histograms of ferritin categories
- Interpretation of results based on current clinical and statistical references

## Key Highlights

- **Ferritin Explained:** Ferritin is a blood protein that reflects the body's iron stores. Its protein shell can store up to 4,500 iron atoms, which are essential for energy metabolism, oxygen transport, and overall health.
- **WHO Context:** "The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 42% of children under 5 years of age and 40% of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic. Iron deficiency, haemoglobinopathies, and malaria are considered the three top causes of anaemia globally."

- **NHANES Dataset:** The analysis uses NHANES 2021–2023 data to examine ferritin levels in US women aged 18–49.
